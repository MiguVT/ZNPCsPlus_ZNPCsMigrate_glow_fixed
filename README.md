[ZNPCsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/znpcsplus.109380/) is a Spigot plugin that is used to create fake entities 
that players can interact with to perform actions like switching servers on a network or executing commands.

This plugin is a remake of a plugin called ZNPCs, we originally started because the maintainer of ZNPCs decided to announce that he was 
[dropping support for the plugin](https://github.com/Pyrbu/ZNPCsPlus/blob/2.X/.github/znpc.png?raw=true).

Looking for up-to-date builds of the plugin? Check out our [Jenkins](https://ci.pyr.lol/job/ZNPCsPlus/)
